# Rotaract Club of Lilongwe — Member Management System

A member management system and public website for the Rotaract Club of Lilongwe (RAC), built with **SvelteKit** and **Supabase**. It manages the full member lifecycle and tracks club events and activities in one place.

---

## What this is

The system brings together a public-facing website and a private member/admin portal, so the club can:

- Receive and process membership applications online.
- Manage an up-to-date member directory, profiles, dues, and volunteer hours.
- Track events and activities — meetings, attendance, volunteer work, and project leads.
- Coordinate the End Polio campaign with a shared content calendar tracker.

## Key features

### Public website
- **Homepage, About, Projects, Partnerships, Donate** — club information and outreach pages.
- **Join** — a two-step membership application form.
- **Member Login** — members sign in with their assigned RAC number.
- **End Polio tracker** — a content calendar used to plan and track campaign posts.

### Member portal

## Access model

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Visitor | Public pages, submit a join application, End Polio tracker |
| Member | Everything public, plus their own portal profile, the member directory, dues, attendance, and volunteer records |
| Admin | Everything above, plus the admin panel (applications, members, activities, attendance, dues, donations, partnerships, volunteer hours) |

---

## Core workflows

### Membership application
1. A visitor submits the join form.
2. An admin reviews it, changes the status, and approves it — assigning a RAC number and creating the member record.
3. The new member signs in at the login page and completes their profile.

### Events & activities
1. Club events and projects are logged in the activities module.
2. Attendance and volunteer hours are recorded against members.
3. Dues are tracked alongside member records for a full view of each member's involvement.

### End Polio campaign
- The calendar tracker plans weekly posts for each campaign month and tracks completion progress, synced so it persists across devices.
